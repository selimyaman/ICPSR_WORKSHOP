# Materials for the workshop "Navigating the Landscape of Transformers: A Hands-On Introductory Workshop"

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to "Navigating the Landscape of Transformers: A Hands-On Introductory Workshop", a workshop tailored to offer insights and hands-on experience with NLP tools. This workshop is a part of the course `Machine Learning: Applications in Social Science Research` at [ICPSR 2023](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/sumprog/).


This repository houses a selection of Jupyter notebooks that serve as core resources for the workshop. If you wish to actively run the notebooks, simply open the .ipynb files right here on GitHub and select the Open in Colab button situated at the top of the notebook. This will subsequently launch the notebook in Google Colab, where you'll have the ability to execute the code using free cloud-based CPUs or GPUs.


**Workshop Overview** 

Transformers, particularly pre-trained models like BERT or GPT, are gaining traction in social sciences. These models are complex - yet easy to use. We'll be demonstrating how accessible and user-friendly these models have become, thanks to powerful open-source packages like Hugging Face Transformers.

We will kick off the workshop with some introductry slides (see the `slides.pdf`) to the concept of transfer learning and language models. Then we'll move to the interactive session, where we'll collectively fine-tune and evaluate a Transformer for a standard political science task. We'll use Python for demonstration, however, it's not a prerequisite for attendees to be familiar with it.
